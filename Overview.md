This file is written in Markdown, although that is obvious.

## Purpose 
This Python program was written to test the capability of Python to create classes and Objects. The test consists of creating a proto-class called polyhedron. Classes with different number of sides are derived from this class. In paarticular, I've created the class Die, which has (obviously) six sides.

Is BBEdit smart enough to **understand** that this file is in Markdown? Apparently it does _understand_ since it uses syntax highlighting to show the `elements` of the markup language.
