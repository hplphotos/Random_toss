	'''Polyhedron is a proto-class for creating sub-objects
	that can be used for random outcomes. Examples are coins,
	die, roulette, draedle, and playing card.
	There are two class variables:
	poly_type (str) for describing the sub-orject (coin, die, etc.)
	numb_sides (int) which is the number of sides of the object 
		e.g., 2 for coin, 6 for a die
	There is an instance variable (outcome) that stores the result
	of the throw memthod.
	There are also two methods, an _init__ and a throw method.
	The throw method generates a random int between 1 and mumb_sides
